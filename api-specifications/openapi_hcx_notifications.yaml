        The participant should send the below details in the request body while making a call for notification subscription.
          1. The protocol headers defined and used by all the other APIs to understand the sender, recipient, status etc,.
          2. The notification topic_code (as x-hcx-notification_subscription.topic_code) to understand the notification to which the participant want to subscribe.
        
        The response to this API could be one of the following:
          1. A successful accepted (202) response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful. Upon successful validation, HCX gateway forwards the same request to the intended recipient asynchronously.
          2. A  successful OK (200) response from the HCX gateway if the strucuture of the request is valid and the validation of open attributes (protocol headers) is successful and the recipient is HCX gateway. There is no callback expected in this case.
          3. An error response if any of the validations fail.
        
        If the request is validated and accepted by HCX gateway, based on recipient it will be processed. If it recipient is not HCX gateway, the request will be forwarded to recipient and the participant should expect a response via callback API from recipient.

            1. JWS Protected headers (**protected**) - A set of attributes that provide transport, security, message integrity and summary information about the message being exchanged.
        
            2. JWS Payload (**payload**) - Payload containing the relevant domain entity (eObject) as prescribed for the use case by the domain specifications. This needs to be encrypted so that HCX cannot read this.
        
            3. JWS Signature (**signature**) - Digital signature on the protected header and the payload of the message to ensure its integrity.
            
            The final payload should be serialzed using JWS compact serialization as defined in the RFC-7515 -

            Detailed steps on how to construct the JWS token are provided in this [section](https://docs.swasth.app/hcx-specifications/hcx-technical-specifications/open-protocol/data-security-and-privacy/message-security-and-integrity#message-encryption) of the HCX specifications.

Header values are posted in clear and must never contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the patient or any person. HCX protocol uses JWE protected headers for such information to ensure these are not tampered with by the intermediate gateways. Protected Headers for HCX will be the union of the following three header categories.
          
                JOSE Headers - JSON Web Signature header as per [RFC7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#page-9). For HCX V0.8, this is proposed to be fixed to {"alg":"RS256"}
